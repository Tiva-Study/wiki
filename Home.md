# Tiva-Study London

We're a group of Londoners studying programming on the
[Tiva-C LaunchPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiva-C_LaunchPad)
(formerly called Stellaris LaunchPad). We are interested in the
lowlevel workings of the Cortex-M4 CPU used on these boards and on
generally learning microcontroller programming on a deeper level. For
that purpose we're following the UTAustinX courses on EDX (see
Resources section below).

We are generally meeting every Sunday evening from 7 PM at the tables
in the basement at the [London Hackspace](https://london.hackspace.org.uk/).

Join our [[Mailing_List]] to get up to date information.
